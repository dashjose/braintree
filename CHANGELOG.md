    Braintree and BTPayPalButton.
    * If you were previously relying on the completion block for receiving a payment method nonce,
      you should replace that code with a delegate method implementation which reads the nonce from

  * Demo App now points to a publicly accessible merchant server

* Enhancements:
  * Drop-In now supports server-side validation, including CVV/AVS verification failure
